There are three programs in this folder: broken.c, broken2.c, and broken3.c. Each contains at least several bugs.
Your task is to identify these bugs and squash them (i.e. fix the programs so they can compile and run).
The rule is to always start by fixing the first error found in your program as it may be the cause of errors later on.

Before doing any debugging, try to compile each program (remember how?). Note the errors that pop up; we will log them here.
It is essential that you not only learn to debug your code but also begin to recognize the language of common errors.
The compiler will tell you what is wrong with your code, but some errors are less obvious at the beginning of your coding journey.

broken.c
What is the first error that is printed? Where is it located? How can you fix it?

Fix only this one error, try to compile it again, and identify the next error, its location, and its fix below (repeat as needed).


broken2.c
What is the first error that is printed? Where is it located? How can you fix it?

Fix only this one error, try to compile it again, and identify the next error, its location, and its fix below (repeat as needed).


broken3.c
What is the first error that is printed? Where is it located? How can you fix it?

Fix only this one error, try to compile it again, and identify the next error, its location, and its fix below (repeat as needed).


A few more questions for you once you fix each program.
When in doubt, use Google and the CS50 AP Portal. Complete sentences not required.

0. What is "boilerplate code" in C?
1. What are the rules for naming variables in C?
10. What is camelCase?
11. What is the difference between data types int and float?
100. What is the difference between data types int and long long?
101. What is the technical term for the "%" placeholder found in a printf command?
110. When would you use "%s" instead of "%c"?
111. When would you use "%lld" instead of "%d"?
1000. When would you use "%f" instead of "%d"?

Bonus: write a program called fun.c that prints a message to the screen, asks for user input, and/or works with variables.
