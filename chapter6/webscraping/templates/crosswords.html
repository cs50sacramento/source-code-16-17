        <h1><i>Cryptic Crosswords</i></h1>
        <div id="text">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Cryptic crosswords, or "British crosswords," are enjoyable word puzzles that pose a different challenge from the standard American fare. In cryptics, each clue contains exactly two elements: a definition of a word and wordplay appropriate to that word. After the clue, there is a number indicative of the number of letters in the word and whether the answer is a compound word or a phrase made up of multiple words.</p>
            <p>This wordplay can consist of a number of elements: homonyms, anagrams, charades, etc. For example, the answer to the clue "New thing in fruit combat (8)" is "Fighting." Fighting is an 8-letter word for "combat"--simple enough. "New thing" tells me I need to rearrange thing in some new way (anagram!) and fit into a fruit. In this case the fruit is a "fig." The wordplay answer looks like this: Fi(ghtin)g. The challenge with each clue is deciphering where the wordplay begins and ends, so too the definition.</p>
            <p>Here is another example: "Chai killing off a Greek character" (3). Right away, there are several possibilities for what the real word could be: Chai, a Greek character, Greek character, character. I know this because the real word comes at either the beginning or the end of the clue. This is one of the rules of cryptic cluing. There are several three-letter Greek characters, so I'll look at the beginning next. "Chai killing off a" tells me literally what to do: remove the a (kill it off) from chai. This leaves me with "Chi," an appropriate three-letter Greek character.</p>
